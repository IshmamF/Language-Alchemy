## Overview
Welcome to the YouTube Translator Web App! This application allows users to translate YouTube videos into different languages using the OpenAI Whisper model. By addressing the challenge of promoting fairness, inclusivity, and basic human rights, our goal is to leverage technology to create a more culturally-connected, accessible, and healthier society. As developers, we recognize our responsibility to utilize technology for positive social impact.

## Problem Statement
In the dynamic landscape of technology, it's crucial to tackle the challenges of inclusivity and fairness. As creators, we aim to empower individuals across the globe, irrespective of linguistic barriers. This project addresses the need for accessible content by providing a tool that enables users to enjoy YouTube videos in their preferred language, fostering a more inclusive and equitable society.

## Features
YouTube Video Translation: Input a YouTube URL and specify the target languages for translation.
OpenAI Whisper Model: Leverage state-of-the-art machine learning for accurate and contextually relevant translations.
Cultural Connectivity: Bridge language gaps to create a more globally connected audience.
Accessibility: Make content available to a wider audience by supporting multiple languages.

## Usage
Visit the YouTube Translator Web App website.
Input the YouTube video URL.
Select the target language(s) for translation.
Click "Translate" to generate the translated video.

## Next Steps
We were additionally hoping to integrate both a summarizer and a tone detector for the video in our web application. The code has been prepared and tested / proven to work; however we ran out of time in this 24 hour hackathon to fully incorporate it with our front end.
